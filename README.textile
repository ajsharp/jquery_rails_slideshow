JqueryRailsSlideshow
====================
*Note:* The javascript used in this plugin was original posted by Jon Raasch in "this post":http://jonraasch.com/blog/a-simple-jquery-slideshow. Mad props to Jon.

This is an ActionView helper to create a simple jQuery slideshow. You pass in an image directory (relative to public/images/) and the *jquery_slideshow* method generates a slideshow that loops every image in that directory. 


Requirements
============
* jQuery 1.2.6+ (probably works with earlier version - please let me know of any compatibility issues)
* Some added css (checkout slideshow.css in public/stylesheets)
** If you did a "script/plugin install", slideshow.css was copied to your public/stylesheets directory

Example
========
<div id="slideshow">
  # This means you've got a directory full of images located at RAILS_ROOT/public/images/home_page_slideshow
  <%= jquery_slideshow('home_page_slideshow') %>
</div>

# Use the default options
<%= jrs_javascript %>

# To avoid conflicts with prototype
<%= jrs_javascript(:prototype => true) %>


TODO
====
* Search recursively through a directory for images
* Allow an option to pass of an array of image paths
* Provide more flexibility for how the directory containing the images is found.
* Allow an array of paperclip image attachment objects to be passed in.
* Allow a non-infinite loop option
* Add support for transitions triggered by a click event of a dom object, rather than a timed cycle.
* Allow for different types of transition effects (slide up/down, slide left/right, etc.)
# Re-factor the Javascript block so it's not so hideously ugly.
